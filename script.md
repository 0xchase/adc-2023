### Introduction

Hello everyone! In this talk I’m going to attempt to show some of the advantages the rust type system brings to writing more elegant DSP code. We're going to start with a crash course on the relevant parts of the rust type system, and then we'll see how this can be applied to building basic types, basic traits, and eventually how to compose these DSP elements with a functional style.

But first, as a point of clarification, what exactly do I mean by elegant?
- Expressive - code that’s concise and readable
Safe - code that’s guaranteed not to have undefined behavior and other errors
Performant - these aren’t at the expense of performance
But
Base types
Traits 
Associated type constraints
Basic Traits
